## Project: PIVOT (Police Investigation Virtual Organisational Tool)

PIVOT is a desktop application to assist the police investigators in keeping track of their investigations and relevant information. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 20 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.  

* **New Feature**: Implemented the `Witness` Class in PIVOT. (Pull Request [\#76](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F09-2/tp/pull/76))
  * What it does: Set up base elements of `Witness`
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
  * Credits: *{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}*

* **New Feature**: Added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link]()

* **Project management**:
  * Managed releases `v1.3` - `v1.5rc` (3 releases) on GitHub

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Updated the GUI color scheme (Pull requests [\#33](), [\#34]())
  * Wrote additional tests for existing features to increase coverage from 88% to 92% (Pull requests [\#36](), [\#38]())

* **Documentation**:
  * User Guide:
    * Added documentation for the features `delete` and `find` [\#72]()
    * Did cosmetic tweaks to existing documentation of features `clear`, `exit`: [\#74]()
  * Developer Guide:
    * Added implementation details of the `delete` feature.

* **Community**:
  * PRs reviewed (with non-trivial review comments): [\#12](), [\#32](), [\#19](), [\#42]()
  * Contributed to forum discussions (examples: [1](), [2](), [3](), [4]())
  * Reported bugs and suggestions for other teams in the class (examples: [1](), [2](), [3]())
  * Some parts of the history feature I added was adopted by several other class mates ([1](), [2]())

* **Tools**:
  * Integrated a third party library (Natty) to the project ([\#42]())
  * Integrated a new Github plugin (CircleCI) to the team repo

* _{you can add/remove categories in the list above}_
